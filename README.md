The Max Image Width plugin provides to basic pieces of functionality:

* It improves the user interface provided to users for choosing the size
  of the thumbnail they want to use in a post upon uploading a new image.

* It allows administrators to set and enforce a maximum image width for
  images that can be inserted. 

The plugin was originally born out of a need of a blog network whose 
bloggers were consistently inserting images into a post, but were
creating thumbnails that were too large for the given layout. As a 
result layouts could break, or a portion of the image was obscured
by other page elements.
